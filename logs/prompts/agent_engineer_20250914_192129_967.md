INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Initialize the mcp-browser project with comprehensive documentation and single-path workflows. The project has just been implemented with:

## Project Context
- **Type**: Python MCP server with Chrome extension
- **Architecture**: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Dependency Injection
- **Structure**: Already created with src/, extension/, and configuration files
- **Framework**: Custom asyncio WebSocket server, MCP Python SDK
- **Key Services**: WebSocket, Storage, Browser, MCP, Screenshot services

## Tasks to Complete

1. **Create CLAUDE.md** with priority-based organization:
   - 🔴 CRITICAL: SOA/DI requirements, 500-line limit, async patterns
   - 🟡 IMPORTANT: Service responsibilities, MCP tool usage
   - 🟢 STANDARD: Development workflows, testing procedures
   - ⚪ OPTIONAL: Future enhancements, team collaboration

2. **Establish Single-Path Workflows**:
   - ONE way to build: Create Makefile with clear targets
   - ONE way to test: Set up testing framework
   - ONE way to deploy: Installation and Chrome extension loading
   - ONE way to develop: Service modification patterns

3. **AST Analysis**:
   - Analyze Python service files in src/services/
   - Document service interfaces and dependencies
   - Create CODE_STRUCTURE.md with architecture insights

4. **Tool Configuration**:
   - Set up ruff for Python linting
   - Configure black for formatting
   - Set up pytest for testing
   - Create pre-commit hooks

5. **Memory System**:
   - Initialize .claude-mpm/memories/ directory
   - Document project-specific patterns
   - Capture architectural decisions

6. **Developer Documentation**:
   - Create DEVELOPER.md with technical details
   - Document service interfaces
   - Explain DI container usage
   - Chrome extension development guide

7. **Holistic Organization** (Final step):
   - Review all created documentation
   - Ensure priority rankings are clear
   - Validate single-path principle
   - Add meta-instructions for maintenance

Please create all necessary files and configurations, ensuring everything follows the single-path principle and is optimized for AI agent understanding.
